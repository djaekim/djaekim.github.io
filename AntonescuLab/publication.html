            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a major regulator of cell-surface protein internalization. Clathrin and other proteins assemble
              into small invaginating structures at the plasma membrane termed clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) that mediate vesicle
              formation. In addition, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is regulated by its accumulation
              within CCPs. Given the diversity of proteins regulated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, how this process may
              distinctly regulate specific receptors is a key question. We examined the selective regulation of clathrin-dependent
              EGFR signaling and endocytosis. We find that perturbations of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1), Ca2+, or protein kinase
              C (PKC) impair clathrin-mediated endocytosis of EGFR, the formation of CCPs harboring EGFR, and EGFR signaling.
              Each of these manipulations was without effect on the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin receptor
              (TfR). EGFR and TfR were recruited to largely distinct clathrin structures. In addition to control of initiation
              and assembly of CCPs, EGF stimulation also elicited a Ca2+- and PKC-dependent reduction in synaptojanin1 recruitment
              to clathrin structures, indicating broad control of CCP assembly by Ca2+ signals. Hence EGFR elicits PLCγ1-calcium
              signals to facilitate formation of a subset of CCPs, thus modulating its own signaling and endocytosis. This
              provides evidence for the versatility of CCPs to control diverse cellular processes.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              Compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells into dynamic organelles that exchange material through regulated membrane traffic
              governs virtually every aspect of cellular physiology including signal transduction, metabolism and transcription.
              Much has been revealed about the molecular mechanisms that control organelle dynamics and membrane traffic
              and how these processes are regulated by metabolic, physical and chemical cues. From this emerges the understanding
              of the integration of specific organellar phenomena within complex, multiscale and nonlinear regulatory networks.
              In this review, we discuss systematic approaches that revealed remarkable insight into the complexity of these
              phenomena, including the use of proximity-based proteomics, high-throughput imaging, transcriptomics and computational
              modeling. We discuss how these methods offer insights to further understand molecular versatility and organelle
              heterogeneity, phenomena that allow a single organelle population to serve a range of physiological functions.
              We also detail on how transcriptional circuits drive organelle adaptation, such that organelles may shift their
              function to better serve distinct differentiation and stress conditions. Thus, organelle dynamics and membrane
              traffic are functionally heterogeneous and adaptable processes that coordinate with higher-order system behavior
              to optimize cell function under a range of contexts. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of organellar
              phenomena will increasingly require combined use of reductionist and system-based approaches.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is an important regulator of cell growth, proliferation, survival, migration,
              and metabolism. EGF binding to EGFR triggers the activation of the receptor's intrinsic kinase activity, in
              turn eliciting the recruitment of many secondary signaling proteins and activation of downstream signals, such
              as the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, a process requiring the phosphorylation
              of Gab1. While the identity of many signals that can be activated by EGFR has been revealed, how the spatiotemporal
              organization of EGFR signaling within cells controls receptor outcome remains poorly understood. Upon EGF binding
              at the plasma membrane, EGFR is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis following recruitment to clathrin-coated
              pits (CCPs). Further, plasma membrane CCPs, but not EGFR internalization, are required for EGF-stimulated Akt
              phosphorylation. Signaling intermediates such as phosphorylated Gab1, which lead to Akt phosphorylation, are
              enriched within CCPs upon EGF stimulation. These findings indicate that some plasma membrane CCPs also serve
              as signaling microdomains required for certain facets of EGFR signaling and are enriched in key EGFR signaling
              intermediates. Understanding how the spatiotemporal organization of EGFR signals within CCP microdomains controls
              receptor signaling outcome requires imaging methods that can systematically resolve and analyze the properties
              of CCPs, EGFR and key signaling intermediates. Here, we describe methods using total internal reflection fluorescence
              microscopy imaging and analysis to systematically study the enrichment of EGFR and key EGFR-derived signals
              within CCPs.
