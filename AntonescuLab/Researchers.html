              <p> Cells are made up of diverse and interconnected signaling networks that control every aspect of cell function
                and physiology. These signaling networks are able to respond to various cues, either extrinsic (e.g. growth
                factors and hormones) or intrinsic (e.g. cell metabolism). In doing so, various aspects of cell physiology
                such as proliferation, growth and migration are modulated in response to these signals. Disruption of how
                these cell physiology processes are controlled by extrinsic or intrinsic cues contributes to and drives the
                progression of diseases such as cancer and diabetes.</p>
              <p>We are interested in understanding how cells sense and respond to various cues, including
                <strong> chemical cues </strong>such as growth factors,
                <strong> mechanical cues </strong>, and
                <strong> metabolic cues </strong>, to lead to regulation cell proliferation, growth and migration
                <strong> (Figure 1) </strong>. Moreover, we aim to understand how these processes can be therapeutically exploited
                for the development of new cancer drugs and new strategies for targeted drug delivery, as well as the identification
                of new cancer biomarkers. We are focused on understanding how chemical, mechanical and metabolic cues impact
                various molecular assemblies inside cells, starting with
                <strong>protein-protein</strong> interactions that in turn lead to formation of transient and
                <strong>dynamic plasma membrane microdomains</strong> and
                <strong>signaling platforms</strong>, and how these in turn control membrane traffic, in particular the process of
                clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and
                <strong>receptor signaling</strong>, in particular that of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR).</p>

                <p>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a family of 58 receptors that control cell proliferation, survival,
                  migration and invasion. We focus on study of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which drives
                  progression of several types of cancer including triple negative breast cancer, non small cell lung cancer
                  and glioblastoma multiforme. Upon binding EGF, the EGFR undergoes autophosphorylation and activation of
                  a number of intracellular signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol-3kinase (PI3K)-Akt and Ras-mitogen
                  activated protein kinase (MAPK) that mediate the control of cell physiology by EGFR. Many of the receptor-proximal
                  signals are activated at the plasma membrane.</p>
                <p>Concomitantly to activation of receptor-proximal signaling intermediates, EGFR is recruited into clathrin
                  structures at the plasma membrane. Clathrin, together with ~50-100 other proteins assembles into 50-200
                  nm structures associated with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Some of the clathrin structures
                  at the plasma membrane are clathrin-coated pits, which mediate the internalization and eventual long-term
                  downregulation of EGFR. We have discovered that plasma membrane clathrin structures have an additional
                  function at the plasma membrane that is either distinct from or precedes receptor internalization (

                  of the GTPase dynamin2, which allows EGFR recruitment into clathrin structures but blocks receptor internalization,
                  did not impact EGFR signaling.</p>

                  clathrin structures, which we term clathrin signalosomes, control signaling of certain receptors such as

                  allowing spatiotemoral connection of the signaling circuit from EGFR to downstream intracellular intermediates.</p>

                  </a> EGFR is found in plasma membrane clathrin structures that are distinct from those containing other receptors
                  (e.g. transferrin receptor). Furthermore, the clathrin structures that contain EGFR (including clathrin
                  signalosomes) are uniquely regulated by calcium signals. As such, clathrin structures such as signalosomes
                  represent important platforms sensitive to multiple signaling cues and inputs, and thus represent a core
                  node in cross-talk between different signaling pathways and systems.</p>

                  All cells interact with their environment through proteins present on their outer surface. The dynamic localization of each
                  protein to the cell surface is critical in regulating its function, as the extracellular milieu contains
                  soluble ions, nutrients, hormones, and adhesion sites. Cells must specifically and rapidly regulate each
                  cell surface protein to adapt to changing needs in order to maintain homeostasis and ensure survival. There
                  are a large number of metabolic pathways and systems within cells. Given the critical importance of many
                  of these metabolites to cell physiology and survival, cells must be able to sense changes in flux and availability
                  of various metabolites. In the event of scarcity of specific metabolites or altered metabolic flux, cells
                  must be able to rapidly engage specific signaling responses that can ensure cell survival during the period
                  of metabolic insufficiency, and in some cases engage in long-term cellular adaptation.

                <p>
                  One of the most critical metabolic molecules is ATP, which undergoes hydrolysis to facilitate a wide range of catabolic reactions
                  in the cell. Metabolic stress in the form of reduced ATP availability (i.e. an increase in AMP:ATP ratio)
                  triggers activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Once activated, AMPK triggers activation of
                  many signals, generally leading to either energy conservation (restraint of anabolic pathways) and increased
                  nutrient uptake or catabolism. Central to both of these processes are cell surface proteins, many of which
                  control some of the most ATP-demanding cellular processes such as establishment of membrane potential and
                  cell migration. Yet other proteins of the cell surface are responsible for the uptake of specific nutrients
                  such as glucose and amino acids. Hence, it is quite reasonable to expect that AMPK controls the levels
                  and activity of various cell surface proteins, perhaps through control of membrane traffic processes to
                  ensure homeostasis and adaptation during metabolic stress conditions

                  AMPK controls membrane traffic phenomena such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, it also not known
                  how other metabolic sensors and cues may orthogonally to AMPK to control cell surface membrane traffic.</p>
                <p> In addition, the control of membrane traffic by metabolic cues not only controls the cell surface levels
                  of specific proteins, but also controls the function of transcriptional circuits dependent on membrane-associated
                  proteins. We have recently identified that mTORC1, another metabolic sensor activated by amino acid abundance
                  and inactivated by AMPK, controls the nuclear translocation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), thus
                  impacting c-myc and snail-dependent transcriptional circuits

                  </a>. Notably, GSK3β is localized to various endomembranes and regulation of GSK3β nuclear localization was
                  highly dependent on membrane traffic. Hence, metabolic signals also control transcriptional circuits by
                  regulating membrane traffic and thus membrane- associated transcriptional regulators.</p>

                <p>The regulated phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) gives rise to seven different species of phosphoinositide
                  (PIP) lipids. PIPs are key regulators of membrane traffic and cellular signaling. PI and PIPs are unique
                  among other phospholipids as they exhibit a remarkable specificity of acyl chains, such that 50-70% of
                  PI/PIPs have an 18:0/20:4 acyl chain profile. Recent work indicated that the acyltransferase LYCAT regulates
                  the incorporation of 18:0 into the sn-1 position of PIPs, and thus contributes to the acyl profile specificity
                  of PIPs.</p>
                <p>We recently published work examining how the control of PIP acyl chains by LYCAT controls the levels, localization
                  and function of specific PIPs
                  <a href="http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/28/1/161.long" target='_blank'>
                    <strong>(Bone et al. MBoC, 2017).</strong>
                  </a> We found that perturbation of LYCAT resulted in a reduction of the levels of specific PIPs, namely phosphatidylinositol-4,5-
                  bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol-3- phosphate (PI3P), but not others such as phosphatidylinositol-4-
                  phosphate (PI4P). Importantly, cell biological processes dependent on PIP2 and PI3P, such as clathrin-mediated
                  endocytosis and traffic to and from the early endosome, were disrupted in LYCAT silenced cells. In contrast,
                  disruption of LYCAT did not impact biosynthetic membrane traffic, which is dependent on PI4P. Lastly, we
                  observed that LYCAT localizes to a unique population of ER-derived vesicles that contain phosphatidylinositol
                  synthase (PIS), suggesting that LYCAT and PIS functions may be coordinated during the generation of PI
                  and certain PIPs to produce lipid species with enrichment of 18:0/20:4 acyl chain profiles during PI/PIP
                  synthesis.</p>

                <p> We are currently focused on understanding how LYCAT controls the levels and localization of specific PIP
                  species such as PIP2 and PI3P. Moreover, we aim to understand how the control of PIP species by LYCAT can
                  impact growth, proliferation, survival and invasion in certain types of cancer cells. In particular, given
                  the importance of mutations or other alterations that result in amplification of the PI3K signaling axis
                  in many cancers, understanding how LYCAT controls the function of specific phosphoinositides could reveal
                  new strategies to target specific cancer cells, which may be most relevant in PI3K-dependent cancers.</p>

                <p>Treatment for many types of cancer involves the systemtic administration of various chemotherapies or other
                  drugs. One of the major challenges in treatment of cancer by this approach is achieving selective effects
                  on cancer cells, under conditions that have a more modest impact on healthy cells throughout the body and
                  would thus be compatible with patient treatment. The development of new strategies that can maximize the
                  impact of therapies on cancer cells and limit effects on healthy tissues are very promising to the improvement
                  of treatment outcomes for cancer patients
                </p>
                <p>To accomplish this, several strategies for targeted delivery of drugs to tumors have been developed. One
                  such strategy is antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), in which a cytotoxic drug is covalently linked to a therapeutic
                  antibody, resulting in delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumor cells with a particular marker. We are interested
                  in developing strategies to enhance the delivery and internalization of ADCs into target cells in order
                  to enhance specificity and efficiency of these treatments.</p>
                <p>We are also working to develop new approaches to achieve targeted delivery of systemically- administered
                  drugs that are not targeted to tumors by virtue of molecular ligands. As we have recently published

                  </a>, we are working to develop methods using ultrasound to manipulate intrinsic mechanisms of endocytosis
                  within cancer cells in order to achieve targeted and selective delivery of existing chemotherapeutic agents
                  into cancer cells, and thus improve patient outcomes for treatment with these drugs.</p>

          membrane traffic by various intrinsic and extrinsic signals, and how this regulation contributes to control of
          cell physiology, including cell growth and proliferation, and migration. Further, we aim to develop strategies
          to therapeutically modulate these phenomena, such as to achieve targeted drug delivery.
